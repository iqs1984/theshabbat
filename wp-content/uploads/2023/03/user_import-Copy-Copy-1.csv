In his own words, the rabbi’s goal is “to reach out to the diverse members of the community and to show them the beauty and meaning of Judaism. “I try to help individuals become more connected to Judaism and the Jewish people, with a special focus to reach out to those who, for whatever reason, feel marginally connected.” He works closely with the Cantor and the lay leadership to create services that are spiritual, beautiful and engaging for all who attend. 

Rabbi Mo has served as the spiritual leader of Sinai Free Synagogue since its inception in 1999 when, Free Synagogue of Westchester (where he was the Rabbi since 1994) and Sinai Temple, both in Mount Vernon, merged to form Sinai Free Synagogue. 

A trusted leader in the area, Rabbi Barzilai is extensively involved in a wide range of ecumenical and civic activities. He served as co-chair of The Bronxville, Eastchester, and Tuckahoe Interfaith Council and has also been active in the Community Service Associates, which runs a food pantry and other programs in Mount Vernon. He also serves on the Board of The Counseling Center in Bronxville. “I strive to teach Jewish values by touching people’s lives, showing them that someone truly cares and that Judaism has much to offer.” 

In the Jewish Community, Rabbi Barzilai has served on the Executive Board of the Westchester Board of Rabbis and currently is a member of the Synergy Rabbinic Advisory Committee of the UJA Federation. He has been a member of the Reform movement’s URJ-CCAR Commission on Outreach and Synagogue Membership. For thirteen years he served as Rabbinic faculty at Eisner Camp/Crane Lake in the Berkshires. 

After his ordination from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in 1989, he became an assistant/associate rabbi at Temple Beth-El of Great Neck.

In 1995, she became the Judaic Educator at Camp Hess Kramer. Four years later, when the westside Irmas campus was under construction at Barrington and Olympic, she called Rabbi Steve Leder and said, “Do you have anything for me? I’ll be ordained in a few months.” Steve’s response was: “No. But give me a few weeks and I will.” 

He was true to his word. In the early years of the Irmas campus, Rabbi Ben-Naim served as the rabbi for our camps living in Malibu for 13 weeks each year, mentoring Jewish educators. One of her favorite assignments has been with our Early Childhood Centers. “I found my puppet Sabba — Sabbaba — and he has been my trusted side-kick on the Nursery School Bima for all of my 18 years,” she said. 

As Wilshire Boulevard Temple schools and community have grown, she spends most of her time as the Director of Jewish Life and Learning for the Brawerman School, the choice of hundreds of families for its commitment to Joyful Judaism. “Every day we take the vision of our Board of Trustees and clergy and we run one of the top schools in Los Angeles,” Rabbi Ben-Naim said. “I think we are so successful because our students and families are a part of our historic Wilshire Boulevard Temple heritage.”",Rabbis

Rabbi Mordecai and Meirav were inspired to build a shul that could attract a diverse group of congregants who would share their vision for Jewish life, one that is devoted to Torah study and encourages personal and spiritual development, while exploring Jewish thought and observing the Jewish calendar with passion, intellectual rigor and creativity. 



Non-affiliated, Ohr HaTorah, now mainly online, continues to inspire Jewish practice and celebration in the lives of many in the Los Angeles area as well as around the globe. 



Ohr HaTorah continues to maintain its unique reputation through Shabbat study and classes with Rabbi Mordecai Finley, whose exemplary leadership, erudition, spiritual depth, and renowned teaching and abilities have attracted diverse participants and great following. 



Rabbi Finley is known for his approach to studying text mainly through his weekly Shabbat morning teaching on the Torah portion. Rabbi Finley is also known for developing Wisdom Work, a unique method for cultivating inner life, insight and transformation in one's personal life and relationships. The Rabbi's Wisdom Work method offers a hands on guide for spiritual practice in pursuing a virtuous life of wisdom and conscious living. It is an approach that has transformed and continues to transform people's lives.

I remember the summer that I was learning how to read, my father and I would read the Big Book of Children’s Bible Stories. This was a bit odd since we were not a ‘religious’ family, but something about this book drew me in. There was one story, about a boy named Samuel (Kings 2), who was called by God three times before he realized it was God doing the calling. I would lay in bed at night, waiting, listening, asking, “God, are you there?” Although I never heard the answer, the echoes of my seeking continued to call to me from the depths of my being. 

My route to the rabbinate was circuitous, with stretches of time spent in quest, while other periods were marked by stillness. My journey took me to an Orthodox yeshiva in Jerusalem, travels around the globe, and to the early internet days of Silicon Valley. All the while, like a magnet pulled by a lodestone, there was a calling toward something I was truly meant to do. I wanted to be an active part of the Jewish story. I wanted to devote my life’s work to the Jewish people, and I wanted to lead us from a common history, toward a shared destiny. 

Since entering Seminary, I’ve served congregations ranging from 25 families to 2,500 families. My rabbinate is defined by my dedication to pastoral care, personal relationship, and helping people discover their own Jewish soul.",Rabbis

“I want to step back, not step aside,” he told the Journal. “I would like to remain as a rabbi of the community. I really enjoy this work, and I have a place here. But I want to give up the administrative and the leadership responsibilities of the first chair. I want to take a second chair position.” 

Feinstein joined VBS in 1993, and then became senior rabbi in 2005 when the late and legendary Rabbi Harold M. Schulweis, then 80 years old, similarly stepped back. Now, Feinstein plans to keep up with some rabbinic duties while finding someone else to take care of the others. 

“The rabbinate in a congregation like this one is very complicated and multifaceted,” he said. “There are certainly parts of which I resonate to so deeply. I love teaching, I love taking care of people [and] I love spending time with kids.” 

He continued, “There are administrative matters and leadership responsibilities I think someone else could take over. Everything has become more complicated than it used to be.” 

Ordained 40 years ago, Feinstein’s first job was founding director of the Solomon Schechter Academy in Dallas. He also served at Dallas’ Congregation Shearith Israel and spent three years as executive director of Camp Ramah before Schulweis invited him to join VBS in 1993. 

This past summer, the board of The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles voted for Rabbi Noah Farkas, 41, who was seen as a potential successor to Feinstein, to succeed retiring Jay Sanderson as president and CEO. 

The synagogue now has a search committee looking for a successor. “Next year will be a year of transition,” Feinstein said. “I will be here and the new person the committee engages will be here. The following year I will step into a new position as the second rabbi of the synagogue.” 

As for what Feinstein plans to do in the future, he is going to work on writing projects — he’s already the author of five books — and enjoying some extra time with his family. 

“I feel like our congregation and the Jewish community in general have gone through a generational shift,” he said. “The same thing happened when I began this job. We went through a generational shift, and my teacher, Rabbi Schulweis, said ‘You need to lead now because you can speak to this generation in a way that I can’t.’ I have the exact same feeling now 16 years later. I would love someone who can speak to this generation, in its idiom, in its language, to take over the principal leadership of the community. I would like to still be involved, but I think in order to reach that generation, we need someone at the helm who speaks that language.” 

No single factor sparked his life-changing decision. However, his daughter is pregnant with his and his wife Nina’s first grandchild, and he hopes to travel more. 

“I look forward to being a zayde, and having someone in the world who I can share my life with in that way,” he said. “I am old enough now to appreciate where I really am in the world, but young enough to enjoy some travel and projects we would like to take on. We would like to spend time in Israel, spend some time on the East Coast with friends who are there – just to enjoy life.” 

As to whether or not this was a difficult decision, Feinstein said, “You don’t give up something this valuable without some qualms and second thoughts and wrestling with it. But it’s clear this is what has to happen now.”",Rabbis

“I am grateful for the opportunity to assist the Congregation, and that feeling of gratitude is the principal emotion of this moment,” he says. 


He and Cantor Shelly Friedman are developing a hybrid worship service—one that would be available both online and in person. 


“All of us need to deal with the experience of coming together after 16+ months of some form of isolation,” says Rabbi Zedek. “What does it mean to be a community? How do we take the challenge of the lockdown and make it a force for continued growth for and in us? With regard to what hasn’t changed, the age-old liturgy and the opportunity for introspection remain vital and essential.” 


Rabbi Zedek has seen a lot in his long career. He was ordained in 1974 and served as senior rabbi of B’nai Jehudah in Kansas City, Missouri, and as CEO of the Jewish Federation of Cincinnati before coming to Emanuel in 2004. 


“The most moving vital part of serving as a congregational rabbi is that every day someone touches your heart, and, if you are fortunate, you may do similarly with members of the community,” he says. “That is a remarkable privilege, joy and challenge.” 


Rabbi Zedek has kept busy since becoming rabbi emeritus in 2016. He accepted an invitation to serve as a senior advisor to the Central Conference of American Rabbis, representing the concerns of Midwestern colleagues. He has also led High Holy Day services for the Thailand Progressive Jewish Community and is finishing a manuscript for a book that he hopes will be published soon. He has continued to be involved at Emanuel. 


“One of my greatest privileges has been to continue Rabbi Schaalman’s Saturday morning Torah class,” he says. 


In addition, he is a volunteer board member for Faith in Place, an environmental justice group that works with faith communities across Illinois, and Arise Chicago, an alliance between religious leadership and workers. 


On a more personal note, he and his wife, Karen, travelled frequently before the pandemic, keeping up with their far-flung grandchildren in Los Angeles and Pittsburgh and family in the Kansas City area. To keep fit, he’s been making regular visits to the gym—although, he concedes, “not always with a smile.”

He enjoys creating moments of connection at Temple Jeremiah by teaching in both informal and formal settings, and through “just living life.” 
He earned a bachelor’s degree from Grinnell College in Iowa, where he studied biology and comparative religion. After college, Rabbi Cohen continued to feed his zest for learning by receiving his Master of Arts and rabbinic ordination from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, Ohio, which in 2015 awarded him a Doctor of Divinity honorary degree celebrating his 25 years in the rabbinate. He earned a Doctor of Ministry from the Bangor Theological Seminary in Bangor, Maine, in May 2001. He is also a graduate of the Kellogg Management Education for Jewish Leaders program at Northwestern University. In 2016 Rabbi Cohen became a Senior Rabbinic Fellow of the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem. 

While in Cincinnati, Rabbi Cohen met his wife, Cathy, and together, they moved to Norfolk, Virginia, where he served as the assistant and then associate rabbi of Ohef Sholom Temple. 

Throughout his career, Rabbi Cohen has strived to help his congregants feel deeply connected to community, Judaism and Jewish life, and for each person to feel inspired to do “Tikkun Olam” to make the world better for everyone. He strengthened this philosophy through years of taking on various social, economic and political causes. 

Politically and communally active, Rabbi Cohen has accepted invitations to offer testimony before state legislative committees. He has served on numerous community boards of directors, including as founding president of the South Hampton Roads Campaign for the Homeless; president of the Greater Portland Interfaith Council; founding member of the Religious Coalition Against Discrimination; founding member and executive board member of the Maine Interfaith Coalition for Reproductive Choices; founding board member of Family Promise of Chicago North Shore; former president of the Chicago Board of Rabbis; and a member of the Ethics Committee of the North Shore Senior Center. 

Through his decades of rabbinical experience and community involvement, Rabbi Cohen has learned that “there’s always more to a story.” According to him, “Live your life from the perspective of abundance vs. scarcity. With scarcity, there’s always fear, and with abundance, there’s always possibility.” 

Today, he serves on the Clergy Advisory Board for the Public Defender of Cook County in Illinois, and is immediate past-president of the Chicago Association of Reform Rabbis.

It is a reflection on the work Vickie and I have done on Holocaust reconciliation in German high schools and the teaching and preaching I have done in German synagogues, churches, at conventions for Pastors, and institutions of higher learning over the past several years. The title emerged from the fact that in most of the German churches that have invited me to preach, I am often the first Jew the worshippers have ever seen. This is my sixth book. 

My first, “What’s in It for Me: Finding Ourselves in Biblical Narratives,“ explores the parallels that can be drawn between the dilemmas faced by the biblical characters in the Torah and those with which each of us grapple daily. It has been translated into German, Russian and Spanish and is available in audio. 

Think about it: Does not Sarah’s horror at thinking Abraham had taken the life of their beloved son; correspond to our horror as news of the Catholic Church pedophilia scandal continues to emerge? Can we not also find Tamar cunningly turning the tables on her child’s reluctant father in news stories of today? And can we not all relate Moses’ reluctance to heed the voice of G-d to our own hesitance to do what is right in the face of what is expedient? 

I am grateful for the 37 (at last count) five-star reviews on AMAZON the book has received, for the reaction to my web page, www.rabbifuchs.com, (designed by Susan Marie Shuman of “Susan Writes Precise”) and the feedback I have received from the groups to which I have spoken.

imills@templesolel.org,imills@templesolel.org,91949ca6ab4bc75d9d1b94af6b65c857,Ilana Mills,,,subscriber,Ilana Mills,Ilana Mills,https://www.theshabbat.org/wp-content/uploads/linkdin/background.jpg,https://www.theshabbat.org/wp-content/uploads/linkdin/217534826_10159380137193149_1246030399312655978_n.jpg,"(Jewish News of Greater Phoenix) — When Ilana Mills was 16 years old she had an epiphany: “I want to be a rabbi.” 

At first, she worried the only reason she wanted to follow that career path was because her two older sisters had talked about becoming rabbis. “I had to figure it out for myself and make sure I was doing it for all the right reasons,” she says. 

So, Mills went to college, but didn’t take Hebrew, because “I wasn’t going to become a rabbi,” and became a religious-studies major at Franklin & Marshall College in Pennsylvania. “I fell in love with Jewish philosophy,” she says. 

After Mills graduated, she didn’t apply for synagogue jobs because “I wasn’t going to become a rabbi.” Instead, she worked at the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism in Washington, D.C., and as a National Federation of Temple Youth (NFTY) regional adviser. “The world was telling me something and I just wasn’t ready to listen,” she says. 

Meanwhile, her two sisters entered Hebrew Union College-Institute of Religion (HUC-JIR) and have since become rabbis. Her oldest sister, Mari Chernow, was ordained in 2003 and is now the senior rabbi at Temple Chai in Phoenix; her other sister, Jordana Chernow-Reader, was ordained in 2010 and is the director of lifelong learning at Temple Beth Torah in Ventura, Calif. 

It wasn’t until Mills had a discussion about God with a NFTY teenager whose friend had recently committed suicide that she realized that being a rabbi “is what I want to spend the rest of my life doing.” 

Mills applied to HUC-JIR and started rabbinic school at age 26. 

No one was surprised when Mills decided to become a rabbi, according to Mari. “She’s a natural. I think we saw it coming.” 

Mills was ordained on May 13 at Temple Israel of Hollywood, making her the third Chernow sister to become a rabbi. The Chernows have made history by being the only family in the United States to have three female siblings become rabbis. 

“This isn’t something that any of us set out to do,” Mills says. “What’s great about it is that each of us found this path because it was the right one for us. We just want to be the best rabbis we can be.” 

Mills feels fortunate to have two siblings who are rabbis. “When I have a problem, I can call my sisters. They know me and they know this work better than anyone.” 

Now 32 and a mother of two boys, ages 4 and 2, Mills will take her first pulpit as an ordained rabbi at Temple Solel in Paradise Valley, Ariz. She starts on July 1. 

Rabbi John Linder, senior rabbi of Temple Solel, says although there were a number of other fabulous candidates, “Ilana Mills rose to the top.” 

“The things we value most about Temple Solel and a rabbi serving our congregation were embodied in Ilana, such as her personal warmth, desire and commitment to forge deep relationships, her passion to bring Torah alive by how we treat one another and the earth, and her wisdom beyond years in pastoral care.” 

Linder also noted that Mills spent an additional year at HUC-JIR getting a master’s degree in Jewish education. “That reflects her passion to bring creativity to deepen our experience with children and families in our preschool and religious school,” he says. 

The Chernow sisters come from a home infused with Judaism. Their mother, Arlene, is an outreach consultant for the Union for Reform Judaism, and their father, Eli, is a retired Superior Court judge who serves on the URJ’s North American board. 

All three sisters agree that Judaism was central to their lives while growing up. “Judaism was just part of everything we did,” Jordana says. 

Mills says her parents set the example that being Jewish was important. “Our home was always filled with Jewish everything. We had Shabbat every week and had 40 people over for Passover. Being Jewish was just who we were.” 

Mari says her parents weren’t all that observant when she was a small child. They sent her to a Jewish school and when she came home singing “the lunch song, which we now know is the Motzi, my parents said, ‘What is this all about?'” 

Now, 40 years later, her parents are very involved on a lay-leadership level. “They’re daveners, they’re learners and they’re very serious about their Judaism. It has really developed a little bit at a time,” Mari says. “They had such positive associations with their own Jewish life and Jewish growth, it just sort of dripped on us. I think of them as the opposite of the parents who said I hated religious school, you’re going to hate it too, so you’re going.” 

Looking ahead 

Mills is enthusiastic about becoming the second rabbi at Temple Solel. She’s looking forward to participating in life cycle events, teaching and having one-on-one conversations with congregants. “I’m really excited to get to know the community and for us to get to know each other,” she says. 

She will also take an active role in Temple Solel’s caring community. During rabbinic school, Mills spent a lot of time visiting hospital patients and working as a grief support group leader. Doing both at the same time showed her the importance of the “after the hospital moments,” when people were grieving and needed more rabbinic and community support. 

Mills thought about becoming a hospital chaplain, but didn’t like it when the relationship with the patient ended after he or she went home. “I knew I wanted to spend time with people after the illness and after the scary moments,” she says. 

While Mills was finishing school, her husband, Colby, moved the family into their new Scottsdale home with the help of Temple Solel volunteers. She hadn’t seen the house since they first looked at it, but that’s OK, she says. “The last two times we moved I was pregnant so I couldn’t do anything. I’m used to other people helping.”",Rabbis

In other words, the rabbi was idealistic at his core but realistic on the surface. This approach made Straus perfect for some of the big challenges he faced at Main Line Reform, according to Settle. A $10 million capital campaign to renovate the building, an emergency fundraising effort after the pandemic broke out and a declining membership that ultimately rose again, among others.

In the early nineties Rabbi Perlstein entered a Doctor of Ministry Program in Pastoral Care and Counseling at the Hebrew Union College–Jewish Institute of Religion. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Ministry in June 1995. 

In March 2001, the congregation honored the Rabbi at a gala dinner dance celebrating his 25 years of service to the synagogue as well as the 25th anniversary of the congregation. 

Rabbi Perlstein has now been the spiritual leader of Ohev Shalom for over forty years and he will readily tell you that he enjoys his rabbinic work more today than ever.

He is readily available usually working with his door open. He is also always available for counseling or discussing some personal and private issue.

My parents were the first ones to foster a passion for Judaism in my life. Our home reflected the seasons and celebrations of the Jewish calendar. I felt as though Judaism was something to be enjoyed and explored. We kept kosher-style at home, we marked the end of each week with Shabbat candles, kiddush, and challah, and each holiday had its own unique home ritual. As I grew older I learned that there was a Judaism beyond what I was getting at home, so my exploration continued into the classroom, the synagogue, and most importantly for me—Israel. 

I feel a unique privilege in having attended Jewish day school from 5th through 12th grade. While a student at The Davis Academy and The Weber School, I had the special opportunity to live out my Jewish identity in the classroom, in extracurriculars, and with Jewish friends who held similar values. I was presented a Judaism that invited investigation, discussion, and celebration. My passion for Judaism flourished at school because I was given space to wonder and grapple with the implications of my learning in a supportive environment. 

The strongest part of my passion for Judaism came only after I had the perspective of Jewish life in Israel. From my first trip, as a participant on NFTY’s 2005 L’dor V’dor Summer experience, I became a committed Zionist who sought to express my Judaism through a love of Israel and living according to “Jewish time.” I became enamored by the Zionist dream to live out Jewish values in our land.

Indeed, Rabbi Schindler is an exceptional preacher and teacher. She has boundless energy. I have heard poignant stories about Rabbi Schindler coming to the hospital when someone was sick and comforting people in their homes after a loved one died. She has danced the hora at weddings and welcomed babies into the covenant. She has shaped Temple Beth El by encouraging us to ignite the Jewish spark within our souls. Rabbi Judy has modeled the possibility of powerful faith partnerships of advocacy and action. I am deeply inspired by her rabbinate because she lives by the Jewish principle that transformed lives can transform the world. 

Following Rabbi Schindler as senior rabbi will not be an easy task! I have always admired Rabbi Schindler from afar. The draw for me to apply for the position and the decision to come to Temple Beth El and move my family to Charlotte was precisely because of the clergy team, staff, and lay leaders that Rabbi Schindler has shaped. My rabbinate has benefited from many rabbinic mentors and friends. I feel extremely fortunate to have a colleague like Rabbi Judy to be my teacher, cultural translator, confidant, friend, and Emerita Rabbi. 

Yes, her role in our community will be different. Her new position at Queens is incredibly exciting. It will give her a platform to impact lives and change our world. She will continue to inspire us and encourage our community towards Tikkun Olam – world repair. We will be proud as she represents us as Temple Beth El’s Rabbi Emerita. Yes, when called upon and available, she will teach, preach, officiate lifecycles, and offer pastoral care. She will always do so as our Rabbi Emerita. Yes, the choices I will make as Senior Rabbi may be different than hers. Rabbi Judy will, as she has already done, offer exceptional counsel and advice. She will support the congregation’s evolving vision as we confront new challenges and walk towards the golden opportunities of tomorrow. 

As your new Senior Rabbi, I will strive to uphold the standards set by Rabbi Schindler and all of the generations who have made Temple Beth El a place of meaning and hope. We will continue to invite people into a congregational community of warm welcome, meaning, and substance. We will aim to make prayer dynamic and uplifting, study challenging and relevant, justice a spiritual act, and caring a daily reality. We will continue to explore how to make a large congregation feel intimate through a relational Judaism that engages our members in small circles of study, prayer, meditation, movement, social justice, and fellowship.

Rabbi Setel’s arrival 
Rabbi Setel came to us in 2015, after serving communities in Niagara Falls NY, Seattle WA, and Los Angeles, CA. Her rabbinate has focused on integrating and balancing spiritual practice, study, and work for social justice within congregational life. Rabbi Setel’s intelligence and enthusiasm can be seen in each of these areas at Temple Emanu-El. As a spiritual leader, teacher, and organizer, she has sought to encourage and involve our members in pursuing a meaningful Jewish life. 

Enlarging the tent 
Rabbi Setel has been an innovator in enlarging the tent of contemporary Judaism. She has developed new Jewish life cycle ceremonies for aging, mourning, and welcoming children into a non-gendered Covenant of the Jewish People. In the 1980s she served as the Rabbinic Liaison to the Los Angeles Jewish Family Service Alcohol and Addiction Outreach program and has continued to work with Jews in recovery from addiction and abuse. In 1990 Rabbi Setel co-convened the first gathering of Jewish professionals and activists working to prevent sexual and domestic violence in the Jewish community.

While traditional Jewish law does not treat fetuses as if they were adult human beings, and thus does not regard abortion as murder (as the most extreme opponents of abortion would maintain nowadays), it hardly follows that traditional Judaism authorizes abortion “rights” as a positive good. 

As polls repeatedly show, most Americans, of whatever faith (or none) fall in between those who (at one extreme) would ban abortion even in cases of rape, incest, or when necessary to save the life of the mother, and (at the other extreme) would authorize it without limits for such “values” cited by Rabbi Fellman as “dignity, avoiding pain, valuing relationships, and other factors,” including the “Jewish mandate to pursue the creation of a more just society.”

La Jolla was forever changed in 1987 when a group of Orthodox observant Jews led by Rabbi Jeff Wohlgelernter established Adat Yeshurun, a vibrant, diverse, Orthodox community known for its welcoming atmosphere of caring and spiritual growth. Rabbi Wohlgelernter initially agreed to lead the synagogue for a year, but remained an energetic and beloved spark, brilliantly teaching and encouraging congregants, and creating one family bound by Torah for 34 years. 

Following Rabbi Wohlgelernter’s retirement last year, Adat Yeshurun’s major annual fundraiser of 2021 will mark the official installation of Rabbi and Rebbetzin Reich, both in person and virtually with its multifaceted event, dubbed “Milestone.” The event includes a Zoom installation ceremony on Sunday evening that will feature a musical performance by Moshe Storch, who specializes in creating a spiritual and uplifting atmosphere. A pre-installation celebratory Shabbat at Adat Yeshurun will include services led by Storch and lectures from scholar-in-residence Rav Hershel Schachter, head of Yeshiva University’s Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS). 

“We’ve come to know Rabbi Reich as a dedicated teacher of Torah, an inspirational leader in our prayer services, a spiritual guide in many of our lifecycle events, and an uplifting leader of our community,” said Brian Marcus, President of Adat Yeshurun. “Rabbi Reich’s vision for our community is clear, his stirring approach to his varied classes is always positive and inclusive, and his commitment to elevating our understanding of Judaism is unsurpassed, touching our hearts and our minds. Rabbi and Rebbetzin Reich have taken over the helm at Adat Yeshurun at this very difficult time during the COVID-19 pandemic, and have nevertheless continued to build on the legacy of Rabbi and Rebbetzin Wohlgerlernter.” 

Born and raised in Edison, N.J., Rabbi Reich received his B.A. in History from Yeshiva University in New York City. He received his Semikhah (rabbinic ordination) from RIETS, as a member of their Honors Program. Rabbi Reich also completed a Certificate Program in Pastoral Mental Health Counseling. 

“As a child, I can vividly remember the warm and loving interactions among my grandparents,” Rabbi Reich said. “It was a sight to see as my paternal grandfather, Saba Yehuda z”l, a Holocaust survivor, who spent his adolescence in Auschwitz, and his wife Savta Sarah a”h, a religious Libyan woman, would share a heartfelt interaction with my maternal grandmother, Mommom, a traditional Conservative Jew whose American roots in Somerville, N.J., date back to the 1870s. Through language and cultural barriers, they loved and respected each other. I knew this because they would each respectively educate me to love and respect every Jew and member of society, but even more so I knew this because I witnessed them, as well as my parents, live this way. This fundamental lesson that was fostered at a young age was a personal priority in my family and my community, and it was emphasized in the education I received. This has always been one of the driving forces behind my passion to become a rabbi, and how to lead a congregation.” 

Rabbi Reich met his Rebbetzin, Brooke, a native of Englewood, N.J., when they were both completing their undergraduate studies at Yeshiva University. They have been married for seven years and currently live in La Jolla Shores with their two daughters, Leeba and Shira and their son, Asher. Brooke, a licensed Social Worker (LCSW), received both her undergraduate and graduate degrees from Yeshiva University. 

In addition to their roles as the Rabbi and Rebbetzin of Adat Yeshurun, the Reichs devote their time to San Diego’s local yeshivas. Brooke is a beloved Judaic Studies faculty member at San Diego Hebrew Day School, while Rabbi Reich teaches at Southern California Yeshiva High School and Torah High School.",Rabbis

Two years ago, from her hometown of Houston, Texas, she began flying weekly to Los Angeles to study at the Academy for Jewish Religion. There she met Paula Marcus, assistant rabbi at Temple Beth El in Aptos, not far from the home of Israel’s daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren in Santa Cruz. Knowing her colleague wanted to find a congregation to serve, and relocate closer to her family, Marcus told Israel of an opening at Emeth. 

“It’s such a blessing that an opening would happen here where my family is at this stage in my life,” says Israel, who takes the pulpit for her first time Friday. 

Emeth is a small-but-growing Jewish community of about 60 families living in the Morgan Hill-Gilroy area. Of those, roughly half live in Morgan Hill, says the congregation’s past president Michael Oshan. The rest, he says, live in Gilroy and Hollister. 

The group is currently without a synagogue, but has plans to build a temple on Vineyard Boulevard in Morgan Hill. They have a permit from the city, but are still raising funds and ironing out details with a developer. Meanwhile, the group continues to hold services at Carden Academy, a Morgan Hill private school. 

For Israel, it’s her first job providing rabbinic services, and she’ll be helping the congregation position itself for more growth as the Bay Area’s population continues to soar, spilling into bedroom communities from Danville to Gilroy, bringing more Jews to areas not traditionally known for religious diversity. 

It’s a situation Israel knows well. She grew up in a relatively small, tight-knit Orthodox community in Houston, a city whose Jewish population wasn’t always so noticeable, but today is recognized as one of the nation’s fastest growing, numbering about 50,000. 

“There are certainly unique aspects to this that are a tremendous positive challenge,” she says of her one-year commitment to Emeth, which over the years has attracted families whose roots are often in other cities. 

“One of the things about Emeth is that it’s an extraordinarily warm, welcoming community. In the presence of their members one feels they’re in the midst of family. So, I think as this community grows, and people will be further away from their hometowns and their families, this will provide an extended family for them. That’s one of things I’m committed to – making sure that they’re comfortable, that they do feel at home in the Jewish community here.” 

Founded some 30 years ago, the congregation practices Reform Judaism, meaning its members don’t necessarily observe all the tenets of Orthodox Judaism. Israel says her training at the Academy for Jewish Religion – where she’s on a five-year track to being ordained as a rabbi – is geared toward meeting the needs of those from both traditional and liberal backgrounds. It’s an asset in places such as South County, she says, where there aren’t too many resources for the Jewish community as a whole. “We’re being trained to reach out to Jews wherever they’re at on their spiritual path,” she explains. 

The biggest issue particular to South County Jews, Oshan says, is lack of a critical mass of Jewish members in the community. 

“For the most part, the Jewish population here is well assimilated into the general population and many have yet to recognize the value in becoming affiliated with our group,” he says. “Our group is very inclusive and works toward making all types of Jewish people feel comfortable.” 

He says the group is working toward an expansion of the Jewish community to include “cultural or secular” Jews, not just those that are looking for spiritual guidance or a religious experience. 

“The issues surrounding the Middle East today,” Oshan says, “demonstrate the strong need to maintain a Jewish identity.” 

Morgan Hill resident Marilyn Freund, who co-chairs the congregation’s women’s group Emeth Sisterhood, says embracing diversity and interfaith marriages are important aspects of the congregation. 

“We’re a small but active group,” Freund adds, “and we want to grow very much.” 

While many see Morgan Hill and Gilroy as bedroom communities, with a number of residents commuting daily to Silicon Valley jobs, Israel says the potential for religious and spiritual growth remains high at the local level. 

“I don’t think the bedroom community, or the rural community, is really the important aspect, because I think that whether you’re in a large community, an urban city or a small area like this, I think people’s spiritual needs are the same,” she says. “To feel like they’re touched by religion, touched by the community, and in a relationship with God … those are the same things no matter where people live.” 

The congregation hopes to eventually provide a center for Jewish life in South County with its new temple. 

“I don’t know that we’re lacking cohesiveness,” Israel says, “but there is something to be said for having a physical structure that a person can go to at any time, can knock on the door and know there is someone in the building that can help them with their needs, whatever that may be.” 

Asked how she might harness the region’s love of technology to help the congregation grow, Israel says there are definitely educational opportunities online she hopes to offer congregates. For instance, she recently downloaded a transliterated Hebrew service. On the other hand, while she’s heard of some congregations in large cities offering their services online, she says she primarily views the nature of her job as reaching individuals personally. 

“In Judaism,” she notes, “there are many prayers that can only be said in the presence of 10 adults. It’s a religion that’s based on community. While there are educational opportunities on the Internet, the essence of the religion takes place one-on-one, and that’s really where I will be putting my energy.” 

For the time being, she’ll need to summon her faith on the drive to work from Capitola. The Santa Cruz Mountains can be a daunting obstacle. 

“I come from Houston where everything is flat,” she laughs. “These mountainous passages are a challenge for me. But I noticed today when I came over Hecker Pass, it was not a big deal.”",Rabbis

Raphael, Ph.D. ’74, on March 17 at his home in San Francisco. 

From 1973 to 1996, Larry served as Assistant and Associate Dean, as well as Dean of Administration at our New York Campus. He played a vital role in the admission, education, and professional training of over a thousand Reform rabbis, cantors, and educators at HUC-JIR. He was instrumental in the founding and supervision of the Soup Kitchen, which has fed over 150,000 guests since its inception over 30 years ago, and implemented educational initiatives, using the latest computer technologies and the newly emerging Internet, for students, faculty, and alumni. Throughout these years, he served as the rabbi of High Holy Day Services for Young Adults, sponsored by the Metropolitan Conference of the National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods and HUC-JIR, which were attended by hundreds of worshippers at our campus each year. 

Rabbi Raphael joined the UAHC (today the URJ) in 1996 as the first director of the Department of Adult Jewish Growth. In that capacity, he directed special retreat programs and the Kallot national study and spiritual events, and was responsible for adult education materials, including the weekly publication of Torah Hayim: A Reform Torah Commentary and Go and Study: Text Materials for Lay-Led Discussions. 

In 2003, Larry became the ninth senior rabbi of Sherith Israel in San Francisco, where he served until 2016. There he shepherded this venerable Bay Area congregation during a time of generational change. His lasting legacy there included the creation of a big tent that offered a home for interfaith families and Jews by choice; building community in a city of changing demographics and culture; and bringing the historic synagogue into compliance with San Francisco’s seismic retrofit mandate. 

Since 2016, Rabbi Raphael continued to teach at several venues in San Francisco. He became an officer of the San Francisco Interfaith Council Board, was a hospice volunteer at the Jewish Home in San Francisco, served the North Tahoe Hebrew Congregation once-a-month, and was a part-time rabbi for the Santa Ynez Valley Jewish Community. 

Larry completed his undergraduate studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz (1967), was ordained at HUC-JIR/Cincinnati in 1974, and earned a Ph.D. in higher education and leadership from New York University (1990) with a doctoral dissertation on “Leadership and Excellence in Theological Seminaries.” He published articles on a broad range of topics, was an expert on Jewish science fiction, and was the editor of Mystery Midrash: An Anthology of Jewish Mystery Short Stories (Jewish Lights, 1999). 

Rabbi Raphael possessed a warm heart, and thousands of us feel such gratitude that we were nurtured by his embracing soul. In Pirkei Avot, our rabbis teach, “Ka-bal kol adam b’saver panim yafot – greet each person with a smile,” and, “dan kola dam l’kaf zechut – judge each person kindly.” Rabbi Larry Raphael embodied and displayed these attributes so naturally throughout his life, and thereby earned the love of thousands. He will be sorely missed.

Rabbi Steinberg comments: “It's a great delight to officiate at a bar or bat mitzvah for a student whom I held in my arms at his or her baby naming, or to make blessings under a wedding canopy for a student whom I called to the Torah as bar or bat mitzvah. I'm pleased that in my years as resident rabbi, I've been successful in encouraging qualified Temple members to teach classes and take strong roles in religious leadership. I'm honored to represent Temple Beth El on issues of social and environmental justice.” 

Rabbi Steinberg is employed by Temple Beth El on a half-time basis. She leads a monthly Shabbat and other holiday services, officiates at life cycle events, works closely with bar and bat mitzvah students and their families, teaches classes for Adult Education and provides guidance for the Children’s Education Program.
